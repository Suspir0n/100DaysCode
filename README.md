## Description

In this readme I will describe what I did each day

## Day One

On my first day I was studying flask, so I ran my first program using a server to view it on the web

## Day Two

On my second day I created a program, in this case a guessing game, where you tried to guess what number the computer was thinking about

## Day Three

On my third day I created a program that told you your github user and a programming language of your choice and it searched and demonstrated for you all your repositories that you had with that language

## Day Four

On my fourth day I created a program that you gave to P.A, a basic program for mathematics

## Day Five

On my fifth day I started studying scrapping, and with that I created my first bot that sent automatic messages to someone on my whatsapp

On my sixth day I created my second bot, a translator bot, where he took any word or phrase of mine and translated it into a language of my preference

## Day Seven, Eight and Nine

On the 7th, 8th, and 9th of my challenge I studied API Rest Full and created a simple example with it, using flask, mysql and pytest, this, I used unit tests in my api that I created.

## Day Ten

On the tenth day I created a program where you said the amount you wanted to withdraw from the bank and it told you how many deposits of 100, 50, 20, 10, 5 and 2 came out

## Day Eleven

On the 11th I started studying about lists, tuples and dictionaries, beginning my 11th day working with tuples, I implemented a basic program to buy school supplies

## Day Twelve

On the 12th I started a routine of creating tests before implementing, and on that day I created a test ondd validating a password creation function

## Day Thirteen

On the 13th I created a program where it checks whether a mathematical expression is valid or not, by the amount of open and closed parentheses

## Day Fourteen

On the 14th I continued my studies of tuples, lists and dictionaries, that day I studied lists and implemented a program that raffled the number of the mega seine and played a list

## Day Fitteen

On the 15th I started studying data structures and implemented the queue

## Day SixTeen

On the 16th I implemented a string reversal challenge, in which case I was supposed to put a sentence in descending order the words, with that I took advantage and put my testing techniques into practice

## Day Seventeen

On the 17th I implemented the test of my study on queue that today resulted in success hehe

## Day Eighteen

On the 18th I implemented a challenge to find out what passowrd with various combination.

## Day NineTeen

On the 19th Today I conclude the study about composite structures, finishing with Dictionary

## Day Twenty

On the 20th, I implemented one function for analize and know what is the bigger, using decoupling. 

## Day 21

On the 21th, Today I was implementing a challenge about creating a bank queue, but I realized that I don't need to create a queue, because in python there are collections about it, so tomorrow I will redo this code.

## Day 22

On the 22th, Today I solved part of the problem with my program, now it's working very well, but the priority queue is still missing.

## Day 23

On the 23th, I implemented a function that returns me a color dictionary.

On the 27th, Today I studied image processing, so I implemented a small program that turns images into stickers.

## Day 28

On the 28th, I'm very happy today, I implemented a program to optimize my time, with it I created my project patterns automatically, like folders that I always create or files, and I also created an .exe.

## Day 29

On the 29th, Today I refactored the code for the time optimization program I did yesterday.

## Day 30

On the 30th, Today I created a readme with all the information from my repo link optimization program: https://github.com/Suspir0n/Lazy

## Day 31

On the 31th, today I was solving a problem in the model documents that goes up to the versel, to download. Repo link: https://github.com/Suspir0n/Lazy
